# How to use

## 1. install package control plugin

Visit package control official [site](https://packagecontrol.io/installation), do as instruction said. Either installing online or offline will be OK. If you have proxy, online will be more simple.

## 2. set package control

Edit the package control setting and user setting: copy my setting to each setting json file. Done. Plugins will be installed after a while if you have a good speed proxy.
